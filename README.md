# School-Code
School coding projects
These are the coding assignments that I have done through my schooling

They are organized by the language used. The only exception is Java. For Java, they are organized by the IDE used.
The Java code in the JCreator branch is from my junior year of high school.
The C++ code modified before 2021 are from my senior year of high school.
  The update in 2020 was to give the program files meaningful names
Everything else was done whilst I was in college at LSU/some basic personal code
