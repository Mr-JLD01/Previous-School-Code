This code is just a way to see the results of my assumed optimal algorithm.
The explanation of my conjecture is in the pdf zipped along with this project.

To run, use command "python3 Reciprocal.py"
NOTE: some of the results rounds to the correct answer but due to floating point precision don't quite equal
